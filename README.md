User Manual

When the main.py file in the project is run from an 
interpreter and the local host has the arrow library 
that can be installed with pip, the title:
'WELCOME TO 'WILL YOU OR HAVE YOU BEEN FINED'
will appear and three questions will be posed one 
after the other with examples on how they should be 
filled.

Once they are filled the project will evaluate them 
and give an answer; immediatly the program will end.

For any more enquiries the program will have to be
started again.

For an easier use it is recommended to use the online
editor used to guild the project:
